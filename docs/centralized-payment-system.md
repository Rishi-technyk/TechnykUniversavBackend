# Centralized Payment Gateway System

## Phases

1. DB Design
   Add `payment_gateways`, `payment_webhook_logs`, and additive `transactions` columns.
2. Backend APIs
   Use centralized initiate, verify, status, retry, admin, and webhook endpoints.
3. Gateway Services
   Resolve the active gateway from the database and initialize it through the service container.
4. Webhooks and Browser Callbacks
   Verify signatures, log payloads, enforce idempotency, and update transactions safely.
5. React Native UI
   Use the shared payment flow and gateway-aware UI.
6. Testing
   Run sandbox verification, webhook replay tests, retry tests, and reconciliation tests.
7. Production Deployment
   Seed gateway records, configure live credentials, switch `environment`, and activate one gateway.

## Required Credentials

- Razorpay: Key ID, Key Secret, Webhook Secret
- Cashfree: App ID, Secret Key, Webhook Signature Key
- Easebuzz: Key, Salt, Environment
- Paynimo (Worldline): Merchant ID, API Key / Secret, Request Hash Key, Response Hash Key, Encryption Key / Salt

## Webhook Testing Strategy

- Use one sandbox gateway at a time and replay signed payloads against `/api/payments/webhooks/{gateway}`.
- Validate duplicate-event handling by sending the same event more than once.
- Confirm that transaction status changes are idempotent and module records do not double-update.
- Verify browser callback flows with signed test URLs and manual app polling.

## Security Audit Checklist

- Confirm only one gateway is active.
- Keep all live credentials in encrypted DB columns.
- Enforce HTTPS on public payment and webhook routes at the load balancer and app layer.
- Validate payment amounts on the server before creating the gateway order.
- Check signatures for webhooks and browser callback payloads where supported.
- Audit duplicate processing by re-running webhook and verify requests.
- Rotate webhook secrets and API keys before production cutover.

## Deployment Checklist

- Run migrations.
- Seed or create the four gateway records.
- Enter sandbox credentials and activate one sandbox gateway.
- Expose signed checkout and callback URLs over HTTPS.
- Configure gateway dashboard webhooks to `/api/payments/webhooks/{gateway}`.
- Run sandbox payment, failure, refund, retry, and reconciliation tests.
- Switch the chosen gateway to `environment=live`.
- Replace sandbox credentials with live credentials.
- Activate the live gateway.

## Production Rollout Strategy

- Start with one module in sandbox.
- Move card recharge and bill payment first because they are easy to validate with smaller amounts.
- Roll out room, banquet, and facility bookings next.
- Keep the old endpoints live while they are backed by the new payment engine.
- Enable webhook monitoring and reconciliation jobs before full cutover.

## Rollback Strategy

- Deactivate the new gateway record and reactivate the previous one from the admin API.
- Keep old mobile module endpoints intact so no client hotfix is required.
- Use pending-payment reconciliation before and after rollback to avoid orphaned payments.
- Export transaction and webhook logs before any rollback change.
